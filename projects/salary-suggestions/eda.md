# EDA

* More than 1200 unique jobs found
* Out of which only on 20 jobs more than 500 hiring was done
* Checked the number of freshers
* Also found some records for which there is no experience but there is salary -> Discarded those records
* Check missing data -- Just for some requisition there job-ids were not found, but later the data was corrected
* When plotted experience vs CTC we found there was no pattern
* We plotted experience vs CTC jobwise then we that there was a linear pattern
* For the 20 identified jobs, we did box plot of experience and CTC comparing different job roles&#x20;
* For freshers, we checked the salary, there was not much variation
* State wise, not much difference in increment -- ?? how do i check this??
