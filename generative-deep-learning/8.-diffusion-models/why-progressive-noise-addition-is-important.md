# Why Progressive Noise Addition is Important

1. **Simplifies the Denoising Task**:
   * Denoising becomes more manageable when done gradually, as the model only needs to remove small amounts of noise at each step.
2. **Better Learning**:
   * The model learns to recognize and denoise images at various noise levels, improving its overall performance.
3. **Prevents Loss of Information**:
   * If noise was added all at once, the image structure would be lost, making it much harder for the decoder to reconstruct the original image.
4. **Training Stability**:
   * Gradually removing noise step-by-step leads to a more stable training process and allows the model to converge better.

#### **Why Adding All Noise at Once Doesn't Work**:

1. **Complex Task**:
   * Removing all noise at once would be too difficult for the model, as the noisy image would be extremely corrupted.
2. **Loss of Structure**:
   * With too much noise added at once, the original imageâ€™s structure may be lost, making it hard for the model to recover it.
3. **Unstable Training**:
   * The model would likely fail to learn effectively if forced to denoise all at once, leading to poor performance and image quality.
