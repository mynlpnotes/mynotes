# The Reparameterization Trick

* It would also be useful to be able to <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**jump straight from an image x0 to any noised version of the image xt without having to go through t applications of q.**</mark>&#x20;
* Luckily, there is a reparameterization trick that we can use to do this
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**We can add two Gaussians to obtain a new Gaussian**</mark>
* We therefore have a way to jump from the original image to any step of the forward diffusion process
