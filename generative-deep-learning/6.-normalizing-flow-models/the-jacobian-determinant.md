# The Jacobian Determinant

* The Jacobian of a function Z=f(x) is the matrix of its first-order partial derivatives

* If we take the partial derivative of z1 with respect to x1 , we obtain 1/3 . If we take the partial derivative of z1 with respect to x2 , we obtain 0. Similarly, if we take the partial derivative of z2 with respect to x1 , we obtain 0. Lastly, if we take the partial derivative of z2 with respect to x2 , we obtain 1/2 .

* This is the scaling factor of 1/6 that we need to ensure that the probability distribution after transformation still integrates
