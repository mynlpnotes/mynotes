# Stacking coupling layers

* To solve the issue of coupling layer, we stack coupling layers on top of each other but alternate the masking pattern, the layers that are left unchanged by one layer will be updated in the next
* If we stack coupling layers, flipping the masking each time, we can build a neural network that is able to transform the whole input tensor
