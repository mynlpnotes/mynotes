* Suppose we have a probability distribution p(x) defined over a rectangle X in x1, x2
*

* This function integrates to 1 over the domain of the distribution
*

* Letâ€™s say that we want to shift and scale this distribution so that it is instead defined over a unit square Z.
*

    <figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
* This function is invertible

* If we want to transform our complex probability distribution over the data into a simpler distribution that we can sample from, we must ensure that it integrates to 1
* We need to multiply the new probability distribution by a normalization factor that is equal to the relative change in area
