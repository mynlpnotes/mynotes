* Real-valued non-volume preserving (RealNVP) transformations.
* 2017
* In this paper the authors show how to construct a neural network that can transform a complex data distribution into a simple Gaussian, while also possessing the desired properties of being invertible and having a Jacobian that can be easily calculated
