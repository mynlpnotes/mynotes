# Working with Text Data

* Text data is composed of discrete chunks (either characters or words), whereas pixels in an image are points in a continuous color spectrum.
* Text data has a time dimension but no spatial dimension, whereas image data has two spatial dimensions(One for width and one for height) but no time dimension
* Text data is highly sensitive to small changes in the individual units (words or characters). Image data is generally less sensitive to changes in individual pixel units
* Text data has a rules-based grammatical structure, whereas image data doesnâ€™t follow set rules about how the pixel values should be assigned.
