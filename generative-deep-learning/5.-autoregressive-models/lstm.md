# LSTM

* 1997
* Long short term memory
* Type of RNN
* Able to handle sequential data by making its own output at a particular timestep form part of the input to the next timestep
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**RNN suffered from vanishing gradient and didn't work well for long sequences**</mark> - Initially RNNs used tanh which gave output between -1 and + 1 but they suffered from vanishing gradient problem and didn't work well for long sequences
* Applied to a wide range of problems involving [<mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**sequential data, including time series forecasting, sentiment analysis, and audio classification**</mark>](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]
