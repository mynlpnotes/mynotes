# LSTM

* 1997
* Long short term memory
* Type of RNN
* Able to handle sequential data by making its own output at a particular timestep form part of the input to the next timestep
* Initially RNNs used tanh which gave output between -1 and + 1 but they suffered from vanishing gradient problem and didn't work well for long sequences
* Applied to a wide range of problems involving sequential data, including time series forecasting, sentiment analysis, and audio classification
