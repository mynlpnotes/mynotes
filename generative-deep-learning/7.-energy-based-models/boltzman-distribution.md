# Boltzman Distribution

* The Boltzmann distribution is a probability distribution used in statistical mechanics to describe the distribution of particles over various energy states in a system at thermal equilibrium
* Thermal equilibrium refers to a state in which a system's temperature is uniform and stable throughout, meaning there is no net flow of heat within the system or between the system and its surroundings.
* In thermal equilibrium, particles in a system occupy various energy states, and the probability of a particle being in a particular state depends on the energy of that state. The Boltzmann distribution provides the probabilities for these states
* Energy states refer to the different levels of energy that a particle or system can possess
* Energy States: These are numerical values representing the different levels of energy that a particle or system can have. Each energy state corresponds to a specific amount of energy
* The Boltzmann distribution then describes the probability of the particle being in each of these energy states based on their energy values and the temperature of the system.

**Key Insights:**

1. **Low Energy States are More Probable**: When Ei is small (low energy), the exponential term is large, meaning the probability is higher.
2. **Effect of Temperature**: At higher temperatures, particles are more likely to be found in higher-energy states because T appears in the denominator, making the impact of Ei less severe.
3. **Thermal Equilibrium**: The distribution only holds when the system is in thermal equilibrium, meaning the temperature is constant and energy is evenly distributed.
