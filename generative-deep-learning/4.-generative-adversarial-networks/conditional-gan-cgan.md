# Conditional GAN- CGAN

* We haven’t been able to control the type of image we would like to generate—for example, a male or female face, or a large or small brick
* Using GAN we will be able to control the output
* The term "conditioning" refers to providing extra information (the "condition") that both the generator and discriminator use in addition to their usual inputs.
