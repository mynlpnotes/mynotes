# Introduction

* A GAN is a battle between two adversaries, the generator and the discriminator.&#x20;
* The generator tries to convert random noise into observations that look as if they have been sampled from the original dataset, and the discriminator tries to predict whether an observation comes from the original dataset or is one of the generatorâ€™s forgeries
