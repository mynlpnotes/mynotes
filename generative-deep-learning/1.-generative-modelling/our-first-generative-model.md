# Our First Generative model

**Generative Model Framework:**

* We have a dataset of observation X
* The observations have been generated using some unknown distribution Pdata
* Build generative model that mimics Pdata
* The goal is that observations generated by Pmodel should appear as generated by Pdata



* Set of points have been generated by using a rule Pdata
*

* And we have to select other points that would mimic as if it has been generated by the same rule
* Using knowledge of the existing data points to construct a model Pmodel to generate points
*

* Data-generating rule is simply a uniform distribution over the land mass of the world, with no chance of finding a point in the sea&#x20;

* Point A does not seem generated by Pdata as it is in the middle of the sea
* Point B is outside the orange box
* Point C can be generated by Pdata or Pmodel
