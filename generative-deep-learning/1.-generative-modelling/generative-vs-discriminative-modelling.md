# Generative vs Discriminative Modelling

* Discriminative model can predict whether a paining has been painted by Van Gogh (Provided it has been given labelled data)
* Generative modeling doesnâ€™t require the dataset to be labeled because it concerns itself with generating entirely new images, rather than trying to predict a label of a given image
