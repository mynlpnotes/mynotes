# Core Probability Theory

**Sample space:**

* Complete set of all values that an observation x can take

**Probability density function:**

* Represents the relative likelihood of a continuous random variable falling within different intervals, with the integral of p( ùê± ) over the entire range of possible values being equal to 1.

**Parametric modelling:**

* For finding a suitable Pmodel
* Family of density functions that can be described using a finite number of parameters, Œ∏

**Likelihood:**

* Function that measures the plausibility of Œ∏, given some observed point x

**Maximum likelihood estimation:**

* Allows us to estimate set of parameters of a density function that is most likely to explain some observed data X
