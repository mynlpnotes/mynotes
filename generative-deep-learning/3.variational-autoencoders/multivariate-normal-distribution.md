# Multivariate Normal Distribution

* Probability distribution characterized by a distinctive bell curve shape, defined by two variables: the mean and the variance
* The red curve is the _standard normal_ the normal distribution with mean equal to 0 and variance equal to 1

* A multivariate standard normal distribution 𝒩 ( 0 , 𝐈 ) is a multivariate distribution with a zero-valued mean vector and identity covariance matrix
* **Mean vector**: It tells you the average values of all the variables you're looking at.
* **Covariance matrix**: It tells you how much each variable varies and how the variables relate to each other.
* This distribution is useful when you want to understand how multiple variables behave together, especially when they might be related to each other.&#x20;
* It helps in figuring out the probability of different combinations of these variables
