# Deep Learning

* Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that uses multiple stacked layers of processing units to learn high-level representations from unstructured data.
* When our data is unstructured, individual pixels, frequencies, or characters are almost entirely uninformative
* The granularity of the data combined with the high degree of spatial dependence destroys the concept of the pixel or character as an informative feature in its own right
* Traditional ML models cannot work on unstructured data as they expect input features to be informative and not spatial dependent
* A deep learning model, on the other hand, can learn how to build high-level informative features by itself, directly from the unstructured data
