# Instance based vs Model based Learning

**Instance-based learning:**

* The system learns the examples by heart, then generalizes to new cases by using a similarity measure to compare them to the learned examples



**Model Based Learning:**

* Build a model of these examples and then use that model to make predictions. &#x20;
