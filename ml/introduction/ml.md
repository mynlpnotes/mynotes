# ML

* Find pattern in data
* First we see the data and then decide which algorithm to be used
*

* Weight is proportional to height
* To remove proportion sign we have to make w = mh
* We add e as h wonâ€™t be able to derive exact relation between w and h
* We can randomly select 2 data points and calculate value of m and e manually, but which 2 data points?&#x20;
* We can select any 2 points, but it wont give best values for m and e which will generalize to all the data points
* Better solution is to give linear regression
* Finding the best possible solution for m and c in the above equation is ML (error is 0)
