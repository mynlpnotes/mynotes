# Linear Relation

* Find equation which can define relation of this data
* 2nd row 3rd is parabola
* 2nd row 1st is sinusoidal, y = sin(x)
* Every line is having equation
* Every equation will have some variables
* If we have equation then we can give input and we will get corresponding output
* R2 will tell how much accurate is the prediction
