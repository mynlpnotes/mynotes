# Assumptions

1. Some relation between y and x, specially linear kind
2. Mean of residual should be 0
3. Error terms are not supposed to be correlated
4. X and residual are not supposed to be correlated (also called as exogenity)
5. Error term must showcase constant variance (Homoscedasticity)
6. There should be no multi collinearity - Otherwise the model will star learning relationship in between the training variables itself
7. Error terms are supposed to be normally distributed
