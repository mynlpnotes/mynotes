# Find Best line, m and c

* Using the 1st records form the equation and then solve for 2 unknown variables then we will get values for m and c
* Similarly then take 3rd and 4th records
* Try to put the H as 5.9 in both the equations and then see the output
* Since 2 different output which one will we select?
* Similarly we can have 3rd equation as well
* So all the equations will give close values, but which one should we select?
* The difference between actual and predicted is called as cost or loss
* Select value of m and c, where error is minimum
