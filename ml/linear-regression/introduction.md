# Introduction

* Supervised
* A is having some patterns, whereas B is not having any pattern
* In B we can divide it into 2 segments and then we can claim that there is some pattern
* Maybe after some pre-processing we will be able to find some pattern
* In A we can many solutions for line
* But we are able to select the best, which can generalize best
* Y = mx + c ðŸ¡ª This is equation of a straight line
* If c = 0 then it means that line is going through the origin
* m represent the slope
* if y = 0.5x then it means that for a unit change in x, y is changed by 0.5
* If x = 0 then y = c
