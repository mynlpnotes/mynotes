# Probability Density Function

* Distribution of continuous random variable
* We will try to convert pdf into cumulative probability -> Usually takes S shape
* If we want to know probability of P(X<40), then it will be 0.5
* In order to find the density, we need to find the gradient at the point
* Since the slope is highest at 40, so its value will be 0.5
* If we do near the end of the curve, then the slope will be small

* Probability Density = Gradient of Cumulative Density Function

**Properties:**

1. Non negative f(x) for all x
2. The total area under the PDF curve is equal to 1
