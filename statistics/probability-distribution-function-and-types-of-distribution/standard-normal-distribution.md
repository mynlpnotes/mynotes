# Standard Normal Distribution

* Using Z Score we will be able to identify how much standard deviation away a value is from the mean
* If we apply transformation and make the mean = 0 and std. dev = 1, then it will be a standard normal distribution
* To convert it we will be using Z Score
* We will find Z score for each of the data value
* So the mean gets 0 and std. dev gets 1
