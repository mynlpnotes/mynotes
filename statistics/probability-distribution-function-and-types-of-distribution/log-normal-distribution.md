# Log Normal Distribution

* Continuous probability distribution of a random variable whose logarithm is normally distributed
* Thus, if the random variable X is log-normally distributed, then Y = ln(X) has a normal distribution&#x20;
* Equivalently, if Y has normal distribution, then the exponential function of Y, X = exp(Y), has a log-normal distribution
