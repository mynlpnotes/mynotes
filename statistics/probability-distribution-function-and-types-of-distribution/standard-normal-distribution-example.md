# Standard Normal Distribution - Example

* In ML, we try to bring all the features in the same unit scale
* If we plot age vs weight, data will be scattered
* Using standardization, we bring all the features in the same unit
* This will improve the performance of the model and it will converge faster
* We also use this in clustering algorithm, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression
