# Binomial Distribution

* The binomial distribution with parameters n and p is the discrete probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of n independent experiments, each asking a yes-no question, and each with its own Boolean-valued outcome: success (with probability p) or failure (with probability q = 1-p)
* As single success/failure experiment is also called Bernoulli trial or Bernoulli distribution
* Basis for the popular binomial test of statistical significance
* Discrete random variable
* Every outcomes of the experiment is binary
* These experiments are performed for n trials
