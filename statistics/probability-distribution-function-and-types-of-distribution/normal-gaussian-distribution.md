# Normal / Gaussian Distribution

* Type of continuous probability distribution for a real-valued random variable
* Most of the data in the world follows this distribution
* Data will be in the form of bell curve
* Symmetric distribution
* In the center we have mean&#x20;
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**mean = median = mode**</mark>
*   As the variance increases, the spread of the data increases
