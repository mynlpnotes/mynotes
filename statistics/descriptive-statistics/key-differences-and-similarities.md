# Key Differences and Similarities

**Relationship:**

* Standard deviation is the square of variance
* If you have variance then we can find the standard deviation and vice versa

**Units:**

* Variance: The units of variance will be the square of the units of the original dataset.
* Standard Deviation: Unit will be same as that of original dataset
* Interpretation:
  * Variance provides a measure of the dispersion of data points in squared units, which can be difficult to interpret directly
  * Standard provides a measure of dispersion in the same units, making it easier to interpret and understand
