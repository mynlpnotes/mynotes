# Covariance

* Measure of how much two random variables changes together
* if the variable tend to increase and decrease together, the covariance is positive
* if one tends to increase when the other decreases, the covariance is negative
* Advantages:
  * Quantify the relationship between X and Y
* Disadvantage:
  * Covariance does not have a specific unit value
  * It can be -Inf to +Inf
