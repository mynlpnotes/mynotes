# N-1

* In population variance we use N, whereas in sample variance we use n-1
* Using n-1 for sample is known as basal correction
* If we have a population data and from that if we take sample data, then using this sample data we should be able to make inferences about the population
* We have population data for ages For some scenario if we take sample from this population, then the sample mean and variance can be approximately equal to population mean and variance If we take n in the denominator and Suppose we have take the sample as 4 points from the left then the sample mean will be somewhere in the left
* So if we use n then it means we are underestimating the true population variance
* If we divide by n-1, then compared to n the gap between sample variance and population variance will be less
