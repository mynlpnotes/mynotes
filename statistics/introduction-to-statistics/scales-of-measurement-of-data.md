**Nominal Scale:**

* This scale classifies data into distinct categories that do not have an intrinsic order
* Qualitative / Categorical data
* Characteristics:
  * Data is categorized based on labels, names or qualities
  * Categories are mutually exclusive
  * No logical order or ranking among categories
*   Example:

    * Colors: Red - 50%, Blue - 40%, White - 10%



**Ordinal Scale:**

* Classifies the data into categories that can be ranked or ordered
* Characteristics:
  * Data is categorized and ranked in a specific order
  * The interval between ranks are not necessarily equal
* Example:
  * Customer Feedback: Satisfied - 10, Very Satisfied - 20, Not Satisfied - 0
  * Education level: 12th, Graduate, Doctorate
  * Using Feature engineering we can give ranks to this categories

**Interval Scale:**

* Not only categorized and orders but also specify the exact difference between intervals
* It lacks a true zero point
* Characteristics:
  * Data is ordered with consistent intervals between values
  * Allows for meaningful comparison of differences (Ratio cannot be measured)
  * No true zero point
*   Example:

    * IQ Scores: 90, 100, 110 -> 100-90 = 10
    * IQ cannot be 0
    * Temperature of 0F does not mean anything, it does not mean that here is no temperature


* **Ratio Scale:**
* The order matters
* Differences are measurable - Ratio can be measured
* Contains a 0 starting point
* Example:
  * Students marks: 0, 90, 60 -> Marks can be 0
  * Weights
