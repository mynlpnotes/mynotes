# Probability Sampling

1. **Simple random sampling:**

* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**Every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected for your sample**</mark>
* In exit poll we can use random sampling
* Draw names randomly from a class of students
* General survey also we can use
* Movie reviews also we can use provided they have watch

2. **Stratified sampling:**

* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**Divide the population into strata(groups) based on specific characteristics and then randomly sampling from each strata**</mark>
* Divide the employees in a company by department and then randomly select a proportional number from each department to form a survey sample
* Gender -> Male, Female
* Age -> ><12, 12-18, 18<
* Degree -> 12, Grad, Post Grad
* Blood groups
* In exit poll also we can use this

3. **Systematic sampling:**

* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**Select every nth item out of entire population**</mark>
* Credit card
* Sales man A -> Every 5th person I will approach for credit card
* Sales man B -> Every 9th person I will approach for credit card
* Selected every 11th member for a feedback survey

4. **Cluster sampling:**

* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**Divide the population into clusters, randomly selecting clusters, then sampling all the members from the selected clusters**</mark>
* Randomly selecting several schools from a district, and surveying all teachers within those schools

5. **Multi stage sampling:**

* Combine several sampling methods
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**Usually involves selecting clusters -> randomly sampling within those clusters**</mark>
* Divide the population into clusters
* Randomly selecting clusters and then sampling all the members from the selected clusters
* Example: Randomly selecting cities, from each selected cities randomly selecting households to survey
