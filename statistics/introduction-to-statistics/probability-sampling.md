# Probability Sampling

1. **Simple random sampling:**

* Every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected for your sample
* In exit poll we can use random sampling
* General survey also we can use
* Movie reviews also we can use provided they have watch

2. **Stratified sampling:**

* Strata -> layers -> clusters -> group
* Gender Ã  Male, Female
* Degree -> 12, Grad, Post Grad
* Blood groups
* In exit poll also we can use this

3. **Systematic sampling:**

* Select every nth item out of entire population
* Credit card
* Sales man A -> I will ask every 5th person I will approach for credit card
* Sales man B -> I will ask every 9th person I will approach for credit card

4. **Cluster sampling:**

* Divide the population into clusters, randomly selecting clusters, then sampling all the members from the selected clusters
* Randomly selecting several schools from a district, and surveying all teachers within those schools

5. Multi stage sampling:

* Divide the population into clusters
* Randomly selecting clusters and then sampling all the members from the selected clusters
* Example: Randomly selecting cities, from each selected cities randomly selecting households to survey
