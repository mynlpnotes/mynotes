# Introduction to DL

* Automate process which we had to do manually
* Even for simple activity like going to a room and pickup a pen, we need lot of programming
* Also there can be lot of uncertainty like some human can come in between n all
* So we need AI to handle such situation
* Inside AI we have ML
* ML solves more of structured data
* But if data is image/video/audio unstructured data, then we use DL
