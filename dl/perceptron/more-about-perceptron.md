* If we make theta as 0 then we can add w0 = theta and x0 = -1
* Now the theta becomes a learnable parameter

* This line is dividing into 2 classes
* b will help to shift the line
* m is rotation factor
* if theta is 0 then line will pass through the origin
* So if there is no bias there is no translation there will be only rotation, this is the significance of bias
* To make a model generic, we add bias
