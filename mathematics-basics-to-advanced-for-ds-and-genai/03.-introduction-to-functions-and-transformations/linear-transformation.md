# Linear Transformation

* A function between 2 vector spaces that preserves the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication
* This means that if T is a linear transformation from a vector space V to a vector space W, then for any vectors 2 important properties are satisfied
  * Additivity: T(u + v) = T(u) + T(v)
  *   : T(C(u)) = C(T(u))

  * u, v -> vector
  * c -> scalar
* Example: Reflection -> Check if it is linear transformation
