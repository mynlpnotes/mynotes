# Vector Transformation

* Refers to operation that maps vectors from one space to another, often changing their magnitude, direction or both.
* These transformations are typically described using matrices and are fundamental in various fields, including physics, engineering, computer graphics and data science
* We are trying to convert X which is having n values into y which is having m values
* Here we have a 3 dimension vector, when we map it to function f then we get a 2 dimension vector
