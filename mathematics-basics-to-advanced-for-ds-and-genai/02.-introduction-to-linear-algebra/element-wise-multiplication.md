# Element wise Multiplication

*   In element wise multiplication, corresponding elements of 2 vectors are multiplied to form a new vector of the same dimension

Application in DS:

* If we have product, cost, discount in our dataset
* Using this we can derive one more feature - Final price
* Using element wise multiplication we can calculate discounted price
* Through this we can create a new Feature - Discount price and Final Price (Using elementwise subtraction)
* In LSTM RNN and GRU RNN in the architecture we will be using elementwise multiplication and elementwise addition for concepts such as forget fate and input gate
