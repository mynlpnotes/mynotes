# Scalars

* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**Single numerical value**</mark>
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**It represents a magnitude and has no direction**</mark>
* Example:
  * Car speed = 45km/hr. -> this value is magnitude, so its scalar
  * Temperature in Celsius -> this is also magnitude
* Application in Data science:
  * Dataset
    * <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**Count of total number of records**</mark>
    * <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**Average of feature f1**</mark>
  * Simple linear regression:&#x20;
    * y = mx + c
    * Here we can consider c as scalar, but m is not scalar
