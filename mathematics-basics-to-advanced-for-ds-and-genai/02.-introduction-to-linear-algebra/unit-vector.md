# Unit Vector

* We represent using ^ symbol
* A unit vector has a <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**magnitude of 1**</mark>
* i^ is a unit vector towards x axis
* j^ is a unit vector towards y axis
* If we say 3 unit vector towards x and 3 unit vector towards y, then it can be represented using 3i^ + 3j^
