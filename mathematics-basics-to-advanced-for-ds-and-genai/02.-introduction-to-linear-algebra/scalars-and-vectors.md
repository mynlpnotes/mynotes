# Scalars and Vectors

**Scalar:**

* Single numerical value value
* It represents a magnitude or quantity and has no direction
* Example:
  * Car speed = 45km/hr. -> this value is magnitude, so its scalar
  * Temperature in Celsius -> this is also magnitude
* Application in Data science:
  * Dataset
    * Count of total number of records
    * Average of feature f1
  * Simple linear regression:&#x20;
    * y = mx + c
    * Here we can consider c as scalar, but m is not scalar

**Vectors:**

* Numerical value which has both magnitude and direction -> Def w.r.t physics
* A vector is an ordered list of numbers, it can represent a point in space or quantity with both magnitude and direction -> Def w.r.t DS
* Example:
  * Speed of the car is 45km/hr and moving towards east direction -> w.r.t Physics
  * Dataset of student marks
    * IQ        No. of study hours        Pass/Fail
    * If we consider only IQ and no. of study hours \[IQ   No. of study hours]
    * A vector representing person IQ and no. of study hours
  * A vector representing person weights over time
    * \[70, 72, 75, 73] -> This also represents vector w.r.t time -> 4 dimension
  * In DS context it does not necessarily have a physical direction
  * In DS, a vector represents a collection of values
  * A is of 2 dimension here,&#x20;
