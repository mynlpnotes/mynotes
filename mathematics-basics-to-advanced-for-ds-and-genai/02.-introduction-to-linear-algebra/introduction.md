# Introduction

**Linear Algebra:**

* Branch of mathematics that focuses in the study of vectors, vector spaces(also called linear spaces), linear transformations, and systems of linear equations
* It provides a framework for understanding the properties and operations of these mathematical objects, which can be represented using matrices and vectors

This are foundational concepts required for learning ML, DL, NLP, Images

* Scalars, Vectors, Matrices, Mathematical operation of matrices, Linear transformation (Used in PCA)
* Eigen values, eigen vectors.....

**Applications:**

1. Physics
2. Mathematics
3. Computer science grad - This is our interest - DS
