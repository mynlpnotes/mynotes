# Vector Databases - Examples of Cosines Similarity

* We desugn a RAG system using vector database
* We have huge book of 500 pages
* We want to create a chatbot
* This should be able to answer any question from this book
* Entire text in the book is converted into vectors
* We save this vectors inside a vector DB
* Query from user will be converted into vector
* Next step is using this vector we will query the DB
* Inside the DB there will be a cosine similarity search
* The vector which had the highest similarity will be converted into text
*   And information will be displayed
