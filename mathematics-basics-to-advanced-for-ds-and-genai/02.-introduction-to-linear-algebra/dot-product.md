# Dot Product

* Dot product of 2 vectors results in a scalar and is calculated as the sum of the products of their corresponding components
* Here A.B = 23 is a scalar value
* We usually do transpose of the other vector during this operation
* This transpose technique is used in ML, DL as well
* We project B as B\` here
* ( Length of projected B vector) . (Length of project A vector) = (2) . (5) = 10
* If A = \[-5 0], B = \[2 2] then it will be -10
* If B is \[0,2]
* Then result of multiplication will be 0
