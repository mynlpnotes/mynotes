# Vectors

* Numerical value which has <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**both magnitude and direction**</mark> -> Def w.r.t physics
* A vector is an ordered list of numbers, it can represent a point in space or quantity with both magnitude and direction -> Def w.r.t DS
* Example:
  * Speed of the car is 45km/hr and moving towards east direction -> w.r.t Physics
  * Dataset of student marks
    * IQ        No. of study hours        Pass/Fail
    * If we consider only IQ and no. of study hours \[IQ   No. of study hours]
    * A vector representing person IQ and no. of study hours
  * A vector representing person weights over time
    * \[70, 72, 75, 73] -> This also represents vector w.r.t time -> 4 dimension
  * <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**In DS context it does not necessarily have a physical direction**</mark>
  * <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**In DS, a vector represents a collection of values**</mark>
  * A is of 2 dimension here, <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**to see this we define a coordinate system**</mark>
  * We can calculate distance between origin and A using Pythagoras theorem
  * Similarly we can plot B
  * Similarly we can do for C using 3 dimensions

* Each record can be represented as a vector
* Lets plot the points with IQ and no. of hours
* If a point is below line y then it will be fail, if its above then it will be pass
* So every <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**datapoint in dataset is represented as a vector**</mark>
* We can do this for any no. of dimension
