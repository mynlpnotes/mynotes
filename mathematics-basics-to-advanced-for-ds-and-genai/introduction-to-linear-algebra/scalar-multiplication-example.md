# Scalar Multiplication - Example

* We scale the data
* We take a 4X4 image, grayscale with each pixel value between 0 and 255
* For image processing, its good to normalize pixel values between 0 and 1
* So we divide every pixel by 255
* This is known as normalization
* If we have height information and we want to scale it to meters
* So we multiply with scale 0.01
* So we have just multiplied by a scalar to scale the values into a different scale
