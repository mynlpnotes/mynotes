# Introduction to Projection - Not clear

* We have a vector v
* L will be a line obtained by multiplying scalar with vector
* This line will be like extending the vector
* We have another vector x
* Project of x on L is basically projecting the vector x on the line
* So we want to find some vector in line where x - proj is perpendicular to L
* Here vector a and b are perpendicular
* If extend the line and find dot product of line and vector
* So whenever a vector is perpendicular to a line then its dot product is 0
