# Unit Vector

* We have a vector v
* We need to change this into a unit vector
* So to do this we divide the vector by the vector length
* This will convert it into a unit unit vector
* If we have point (2,3)
* So here we can have unit vector i and j
*   Then the vector (2,3) can be represented as 2i + 3j
