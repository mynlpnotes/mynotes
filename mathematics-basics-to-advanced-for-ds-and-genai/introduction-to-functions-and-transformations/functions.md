# Functions

* A function is a mathematical relationship that uniquely associates elements of one set (called the domain) with elements of another set(called the codomain)
* In simpler terms, a function maps inputs to outputs in a specific way
* Notation: A function of mapping elements from set X(domain) to set (co domain) is denoted by f: X -> y
* If X is an element of X, then f(X) is the corresponding element in Y

* In the example above we applied a function which mapped a 3dimension vector to 2dimension
* In dimensionality reduction also we use such kind of function which are known as transformation
