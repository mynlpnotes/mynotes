# Vector length

* Magnitude of vector means vector length
* Unit vector has a length of 1
* Vector is usually represented using -> symbol
* Here it means it will be Real number and can have n dimension
* To calculate distance between origin and B point we can use Pythagoras theorem
* Similarly we can also use for 3 dimension
* We can also generalize the formula for any number of dimension
